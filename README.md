# MemeNNIT
MemeNNIT is an app for people who love sharing and making memes.
A memennit user can upload his own memes and view memes uploaded by other users,
the users are rewarded points on the basis of number of uploads and upvotes they recieve.
<br>
These points are used for computing the rank and generating a leaderboard listing all the users.

### Getting started
On launching the app, a splashscreen is displayed, here the app checks whether the user is logged-in through his/her google account
or not and accordingly redirects the user to the **Login Screen** or the **Home Screen**.
<br>
The users can register using their google account only.

 which the user can navigate to different fragments in the app.
